						<h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>1906</strong> - Born in New York City, NY</li>
							<li><strong>1928</strong> - Graduated Vassar with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics</li>
							<li><strong>1930</strong> - Earned master's degree at Yale University</li>
							<li><strong>1934</strong> - First woman to earn Pd.D in mathematics from Tale University</li>        
							<li><strong>1941</strong> - Promoted to Associate Profressor at Yale University</li>        
							<li><strong>1943</strong> - Joins the US Navy (WAVES).</li>      
							<li><strong>1944</strong> - Assigned to the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University as a lieutenant, junior grade. Co-authored three papers on the Mark I computer, also known as the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator</li>
							<li><strong>1947</strong> -  Her associates discovered a moth that was stuck in a relay; the moth impeded the operation of the relay. While neither Hopper nor her crew mentioned the phrase "debugging" in their logs, the case was held as an instance of literal "debugging." For many years, the term bug had been in use in engineering. The remains of the moth can be found in the group's log book at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.[</li>  
							<li><strong>1949</strong> -Became an employee of the Eckertâ€“Mauchly Computer Corporation as a senior mathematician and joined the team developing the UNIVAC computer</li>
							<li><strong>1952</strong> - Created the first 'compiler' for a computer. The begiining of the COBOL coputer language.</li>    
							<li><strong>1954</strong> - Named the company's first director of automatic programming. Released some opf the first compiler-based computer languages</li>        
							<li><strong>1967 - 1977</strong> - served as the director of the Navy Programming Languages Group in the Navy's Office of Information Systems Planning</li>        
							<li><strong>1986</strong> - Retires from the US Navy at the rank of Rear Admiral</li>
							<li><strong>1992</strong> -Passed away at the age of 85</li>
							<li><strong>1996</strong> - The USS Hopper (DDG-70) was launched. Nicknamed Amazing Grace</li>
							<li><strong>2016</strong> - posthumously awarded a Presidential Medal of Freedom for her accomplishments in the field of computer science</li>     
						</ul>
